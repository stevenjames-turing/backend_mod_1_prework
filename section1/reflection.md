## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
  * This article resonates with me because it really points to the flaws of our nations school system as a whole. Learning how to be a great *learner* is a skill set that should be taught to children as continually re-enforced every year as they approach a new set of classes. I believe that I have the abilities to be a SuperLearner, but I need to make small changes every day to ensure I can make positive habits. I already enjoy the process of learning and always want to continue learning and growing. I would like to start incorporating habits of consistent reading and also becoming more of a "teacher" in order to help my brain retain more information from my learnings.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
  * `puts "Hello World!"`

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
  * The # character is used to indicate comments or notes within a ruby file.

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
  * When using numbers in Ruby, an integer is any number without a decimal point and a float is a number written with a decimal point, even if that decimal is .0.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
  * ```ruby
    animal = "zebra"
    ```
1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
  * `puts animal`

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
  * Interpolation or "string interpolation" is when you are embedding a variable or string inside of another string.
  * `puts "My favorite animal to see at the Zoo is the #{animal}."`

1. What method is used to get input from a user?
  * `gets` would be used to get input. Typically you would use `gets.chomp` in order remove the line break from the user's response.

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
  * `.length` or `.size` are used to find the number of characters in a string. Examples would be `"My name is Steven.".size` or `"My name is Steven.".length` would work as well.
  * `.split` or `.split("argument")` are used to split a string into an array. The `.split` will cut the string anywhere there is a space between letters. You could also choose to have it cut instead at a comma or different location by using `.split(",")`
